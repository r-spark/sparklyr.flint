\usage{
summarize_weighted_corr(
  ts_rdd,
  xcolumn,
  ycolumn,
  weight_column,
  key_columns = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts_rdd}{Timeseries RDD being summarized}

\item{xcolumn}{Column representing the first random variable}

\item{ycolumn}{Column representing the second random variable}

\item{weight_column}{Column specifying relative weight of each data point}

\item{key_columns}{Optional list of columns that will form an equivalence
relation associating each row with the time series it belongs to (i.e., any
2 rows having equal values in those columns will be associated with the
same time series, and any 2 rows having differing values in those columns
are considered to be from 2 separate time series and will therefore be
summarized separately)
By default, `key_colums` is empty and all rows are considered to be part of
a single time series.}
}
\description{
Compute Pearson weighted correlation between `xcolumn` and `ycolumn` weighted
by `weight_column` and store result in a new columns named
`<xcolumn>_<ycolumn>_<weight_column>_weightedCorrelation`
}

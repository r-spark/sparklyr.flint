\usage{
summarize_var(ts_rdd, window, column, key_columns = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{ts_rdd}{Timeseries RDD being summarized}

\item{window}{R expression specifying time windows to be summarized (e.g.,
`in_past("1h")` to summarize data from looking behind 1 hour at each time
 point, `in_future("5s")` to summarize data from looking forward 5 seconds
 at each time point)}

\item{column}{Column to be summarized}

\item{key_columns}{Optional list of columns that will form an equivalence
relation associating each row with the time series it belongs to (i.e., any
2 rows having equal values in those columns will be associated with the
same time series, and any 2 rows having differing values in those columns
are considered to be from 2 separate time series and will therefore be
summarized separately)
By default, `key_colums` is empty and all rows are considered to be part of
a single time series.}
}
\description{
Compute variance of values from `column` within each time window and store
results in a new column named `<column>_variance`, with Bessel's correction
applied to the results
}

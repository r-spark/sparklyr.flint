\usage{
future_left_join(
  left,
  right,
  tol = "0ms",
  key_columns = list(),
  left_prefix = NULL,
  right_prefix = NULL,
  strict_lookahead
)
}
\arguments{
\item{left}{The left `TimeSeriesRDD`}

\item{right}{The right `TimeSeriesRDD`}

\item{tol}{A character vector specifying a time duration (e.g., "0ns", "5ms",
"5s", "1d", etc) as the tolerance for absolute difference in timestamp values
between each record from `left` and its matching record from `right`.
By default, `tol` is "0ns", which means a record from `left` will only be
matched with a record from `right` if both contain the exact same timestamps.}

\item{key_columns}{Columns to be used as the matching key among records from
`left` and `right`: if non-empty, then in addition to matching criteria
imposed by timestamps, a record from `left` will only match one from the
`right` only if they also have equal values in all key columns.}

\item{left_prefix}{A string to prepend to all columns from `left` after the
join (usually for disambiguation purposes if `left` and `right` contain
overlapping column names).}

\item{right_prefix}{A string to prepend to all columns from `right` after the
join (usually for disambiguation purposes if `left` and `right` contain
overlapping column names).}

\item{strict_lookahead}{Whether each record from `left` with timestamp `t`
should match record from `right` with the smallest timestamp strictly
greater than `t` (default: FALSE)}
}
\description{
Perform left-outer join on 2 `TimeSeriesRDD`s based on inexact timestamp
matches, where each record from `left` with timestamp `t` matches the
record from `right` having the most recent timestamp at or after `t` if
`strict_lookahead` is FALSE (default) or having the most recent timestamp
strictly after `t` if `strict_lookahead` is TRUE.
Notice this is equivalent to `asof_join()` with `direction` = ">=" if
`strict_lookahead` is FALSE (default) or direction `>` if
`strict_lookahead` is TRUE.
